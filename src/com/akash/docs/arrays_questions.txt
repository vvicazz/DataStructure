(1)union and intersection of two sorted array
	
union and intersection of two unsorted array

	--as technique used in merge sort, after sorting these two arrays   - O(mlogm + nlogn)
	--sort smaller array,iterate larger array and use binary search over the small array  -  O(min[nlogn+mlogn , nlogm+mlogm])
	--use hashtable 	-  O(m+n)


(2)pythagorean triplet in array -- triplet pair in array a2=b2+c2
	--sort the array
	--store squares of numbers in another array = O(nlog(n))
	--apply meet in the middle algo by taking each element  = O(n2)

(3)meet in the middle algorithm -- a+b=given sum , a and b are in array 
  || Given an array A[] and a number x, check for pair in A[] with sum as x
  
	--using sorting
	--using hashmap
	

(4)Maximum profit by buying and selling a share at most twice
10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80
87  (22-10 , 80-5)

2, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80
100 (30-2,80-8)

100, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80

1st approach = O(n2)
--We can use Maximum difference between two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number
--use once the logic to find minimum and maximum numbers with max sum
--then take rest of the array i.e. two sub arrays left and right part of that , one of the part may be empty
--apply the same algo again on that array and find the second sum.
eg:
10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80

5, 75, 65, 80  = 75
10, 22 = 12



(5)Maximum difference between two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number
2, 3, 10, 6, 100, 8, 1

8 -4 94 -92 -7

(6)finding the maximum sum subarray || Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray
