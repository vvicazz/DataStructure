abstract class ClassLoader
	|
	|
class SecureClassLoader

class URLClassLoader
	|_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

sun.misc.Launcher.ExtClassLoader  sun.misc.Launcher.AppClassLoader

==================
NOTE :
App and Ext classloaders are child of URLClassLoader.
Both of their parent classloaders are null.
Classes loaded by Bootstrap , return null as their classLoader name.

sun.misc.Launcher.ExtClassLoader and sun.misc.Launcher.AppClassLoader are static default classes, so we cannot inherit them.
Hence while creating custom classloader we have to make a child class of URLClassLoader.

parent property of ClassLoader signifies its actual parent.
Both Ext and App classLoaders have parent as null.
So If we have a hierarchy of classLoaders, then the topmost classLoader's parent property must be null and other child classes must have appropriate parent property.

public class HelloCL {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		
		ClassLoader bootstrapCL = java.util.HashMap.class.getClassLoader();
		ClassLoader extCL = sun.net.spi.nameservice.dns.ThreadContext.class.getClassLoader();
        ClassLoader appCL = HelloCL.class.getClassLoader();
        
		System.out.println(bootstrapCL);		//null
        System.out.println(extCL.isAssignableFrom(appCL.getClass()));	//false, sun.misc.Launcher.ExtClassLoader is not parent class of
																		//sun.misc.Launcher.AppClassLoader
        //extCL == appCL.parent				//parent is private field, result is true, can be checked from debugger
		//extCL.parent == null				//true
	}
}

==================


java files are compiled by javac tool and converted to class files.
JVM loads class files at runtime using ClassLoader.

ClassLoader classLoader = ClassName.class.getClassLoader();

if class is loaded by bootstrap then classLoader=null

if class is loaded by Extension then classLoader=sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader@4e0e2f2a -- system property = java.ext.dirs == $JAVA_HOME/lib/ext directory

if class is loaded by Application then classLoader=sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@4e0e2f2b -- system property = java.class.path ==  -cp or -classpath command line options

properties of classloaders :

delegation
uniqueness
visibility


Each and every class is loaded by some instance of a java.lang.ClassLoader
Bootstrap classloader is implemented as native and different for different jvm environments.

(Q)If classes are loaded by classloaders , then who is responsible for loading classes of ClassLoader itself ?

(Q) As an object is created for class sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader,which classLoader loaded this class?
Ans : Bootstrap classloader

(Q)Can one classloader have more than one child classloaders?

(Q)Can two classes with same name and same package be loaded with different classLoaders?
com.mypkg.MyClass - App classLoader
com.mypkg.MyClass - Ext classLoader
-yes

(Q)Can Objects of same classes loaded by different classloaders be compared?

When a class is loaded by different classloaders result in two different objects that cannot be cast to each other.
Target t1 = ... 	//loaded by one classLoader
Target t2 = ... 	//loaded by second classLoader
t1 = (Target) t2; 	//ClassCastException

(Q)  How loadClass(String name, boolean resolve) method in ClassLoader works ?

1. It applies a synchronized lock on a map
2. Then it checks if Class class object has been already loaded by this class loader.
    findLoadedClass(String) this method uses native method to check if loaded class already exist in bootstrap
3. Check for loadClass() of parent.hence it goes recursively to loadClass() of each parent.
4. If still it is not found call findClass(String name) method.
	
	If file is not loaded till now, findClass() method compare the class file path with its classloader resource path.
	If they match , class file is read as byte stream.If not then ClassNotFoundException is thrown.
	
	URLClassLoader.findClass()
				|
				|
	URLClassLoader.defineClass()
				|
				|
	SecureClassLoader.defineClass()
				|
				|
	ClassLoader.defineClass()
				|
				|
	ClassLoader.defineClass1()    // it is a native method,which takes byte array of class file and returns Class class object.
									// we also need to store this Class class object against class name in a map.
