Synchronization

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-17.html

Synchronization works on the concept of monitors.
A monitor is always associated with an object.
Whenever a synchronized block come into execution,
(1)first of all it performs a lock action on the object , if another object has acquired this lock then current object has wait for the lock.
(2)When execution comes out of synchronized block , it automatically leaves the monitor on object.

eg:

public synchronized void executeAtomically() {
....
}

OR

public void executeAtomically() {
	synchronized(this) {
	...
	}
}

There are two kinds of lock (OR two kinds of monitors) for a class:
(1)Object level  
	monitor of object of a class is checked by synchronized block
	eg:
	Abc ob = new Abc();
	synchronized(Abc obj) {
	...
	}
	
(2)Class level
	monitor of Class class object of a class
	eg:
	synchronized(Abc.class) {
	...
	}


Object level monitor can be used for non-static methods
Class level monitor can be used for static methods
