(Q) Diff bw kafka and rabbitmq

==============================================
Apache kafka  : distributed streaming platform

Advantages : 
->enterprise messaging system
->stream processing
->connectors to import and export bulk data from database


enterprise messaging system
producers and consumers
P1		C1	
P2		C2
P3		C3

P1 -- C1, C3
P2 -- C2, C3
P3 -- C3
many more systems and many more combinations will be added as system grows
This problem was faced at linkedin and they came up with a solution of kafka

Producers --> Message Broker  --> Consumer

message Broker ==> kafka cluster with many brokers , zookeper

==============================================

Terminologies :

Producer
Consumer
Broker
Cluster
Topic
Partitions
Offset
Consumer group

=>Producer 	: Application that sends data/message record to kafka
=>Consumer 	: application that request broker to recieve data sent from producer
=>Broker 		: kafka Server that keeps data in the form of array of bytes
				message do not contain consumers address, 
				producer just send relevant message to the broker without any consumer information
				Consumer request broker to get data from a particular consumer

=>Topic 		: unique name for a kafka stream, it signifies type of data inside it

=>Cluster 	: running multiple instances of same application
=>Partition 	: Topic can be broken and stored on diff systems known as partitions
				It is like sharding of Topic, which is done by producers.
				topics in a partition are ordered but there is no global ordering of topic in different partitions.
				For global ordering of topics in different partitions, developer can add shard keys

=>Offset 		: messages in a broker as stored as an array in an order arrival time
				old messages to new messages (0 to N)
				this an array number which is immutable

Offsets are local to partition
There is no global offset
For locating a message we should have 3 things :
	Topic Name + Partition Number + Offset

=>Consumer Group : Acting as a single logical unit
				when multiple consumers share same kind of messages
When millions of data is pushed in broker, and single consumer has to handle this data
This single consumer can be divided into multiple consumers handling same kind of requests
In this example, broker can also be divided into many partitions 
and each consumer in consumer group is alligned with some set of partitions.

partitions P1, P2, P3, P4
Consumers C1, C2

C1 <---takes message from---P1, P2
C2 <---takes message from---P3, P4

Partitioning and Consumer group helps us to scale our system.

Note :
transferring data from partitions to consumer group has use cases as:
-> publisher subscriber
-> Message Queue

Every partition has a retention policy of holding a topic upto a limit of :
-> time , eg : 7 days
-> size of partition

==============================================

(Q) Why zookeper is required to use kafka ?

Zookeper is used for reliable distributed coordination

Naming
synchronization accross clusters
Messaging
Leader election
Notification

-> configuration information
-> naming
-> providing distributed synchronization
-> providing group services
-> centralized service 

zookeper server takes machine information and stores it in a System state log.
Master slave architechture is supported in zookeper,
where multiple servers send their log files data master server
Each client machine communicates with one of the zookeper servers to fetch machine data.

Kafka, Storm, HBase, SolrCloud uses zookeper
mongodb and elasticsearch created their own in house product for this.

==============================================

3 paradigms of programming :
-> request response
-> Batch
-> Stream processing => mix of above two

Async applications
large scale data
multiple processes are communicating with multiple other processes
Scalability and partitioning
fault tolerance
