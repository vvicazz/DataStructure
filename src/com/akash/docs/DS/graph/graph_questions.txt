Q)Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph
Q)Detect Cycle in a an Undirected Graph

Ans : perform a DFS in directed or undirected graph. During scanning of each edge, if we encounter any back edge then there is a cycle.
if an edge goes from u -> v
=>back edge in directed graph has two properties : 
	departure[u] < departure[v]
	vertex u goes to a vertex v, and visited[v]=true

=>back edge in undirected graph has a properties : 
	vertex u goes to a vertex v, and visited[v]=true

time=0;
detect_Cycle_In_Graph() {
	for all vertices w in graph G {
		w.arr = -1;
		w.dep = -1;
		w.visited = false;
	}
	Cycle_In_Graph(any_arbitrary_node);
}

Cycle_In_Graph(NODE) {
	NODE.arr = time++;
	NODE.visited = true;
	
	For all w adjacent to NODE do {
		if(!w.visited) {
			Cycle_In_Graph(w);
		} else if(w.dep == -1) {
			//ABORT PROGRAM
			//this is a back edge, cycle found
		}
	}
	NODE.dep = time++;
}
