Dynamic Programming :

Careful brute force = execute all scenarios carefully
Exhaustive search in a clever way
subproblems + reuse

(Q)How DP is related to divide and conquer :

Divide and Conquer algorithms partition the problem into DISJOINT subproblems.
i.e. no subproblem overlaps.

DP is applied when subproblems overlaps,
i.e. two or more subproblems share same subsubproblems.

It computes a subproblem just once and stores it in an answer table.
By this it avoids the cost recomputing the same subproblem.

properties of Dynamic programming :

=>Overlapping subproblems :
When subproblems of a problem are not disjoint
i.e. subproblem share subsubproblems
solutions to these subproblems are stored and reused further

=>Optimal Substructure : 
Optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to its related subproblems, which may be solved independently.

Divide and Conquer approach has optimal substructure property but
it does not have overlapping subproblems property.

=>Divide And Conquer approach examples :
1)Binary search
2)Merge sort
3)count no of inversions
4)Quick sort
5)calculate pow(x,n)
6)median of two sorted arrays
7)Closest pair of points

=>Dynamic Programming examples :
1) Fibonacci Nth term
2) Coin change problem
3) Rod cutting problem
4) Knapsack problem
5) Word wrap problem / Test justification problem
6) Tilling problem
7) LCS (Lowest common sequence)
8) LIS (Lowest increasing subsequence)
9) parenthesis problem
10) blackjack problem
11) Longest Palindromic Subsequence, 	print Subsequence
12) Longest palindromic substring, 		print substring
13) Check if a given string is a rotation of a palindrome
14) longest increasing subsequence
15) Min Cost Path
