In English, Volatile means "liable to change rapidly and unpredictably".

When multiple threads operate on a single shared object,their may be a case where
different threads may have memory inconsistency issues with that shared variable.
Threads operates on variable by first making a copy of that variable in their own CPU cache,
then they operate that copy in CPU register.

eg:
Thread A reads x
Thread B reads x
Thread A increments x by 1
Thread B increments x by 1
Thread A writes back x to main memory
Thread B writes back x to main memory

now x=1
ideally x must be 2.

=>Java volatile keyword guarantees visibility of changes to variables across threads
=>JVM guarantees that every read of the variable will always be read from main memory,
 and that all writes to the variable will always be written back to main memory
=>Using volatile variables reduces the risk of memory consistency errors, because any write to a volatile variable
 establishes a happens-before relationship with subsequent reads of that same variable.
 This means that changes to a volatile variable are always visible to other threads.
 If Thread A writes to a volatile variable and Thread B subsequently reads the same volatile variable,
 then all variables visible to Thread A before writing the volatile variable, will also be visible to Thread B.
=>Reads and writes are atomic for all variables declared volatile (including long and double variables).
=>You need to use synchronization in that case to guarantee that the reading and writing of the variable is atomic
=>Reading from and writing to main memory is more expensive than accessing the CPU cache.
=>Effectively, a variable declared volatile must have it’s data synchronized across all threads,
 so that whenever you access or update the variable in any thread, all other threads immediately see the same value.
