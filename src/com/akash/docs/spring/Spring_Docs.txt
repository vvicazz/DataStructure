As tomcat is a container for servlets,
Spring BeanFactory/Application is a container for beans.
It tracks life cycle of a bean.

BeanFactory, ApplicationContext
property tag and constructor-arg tag in bean

BeanFactory acts as factory design pattern.
Application fetches bean objects from it.
BeanFactory/ApplicationContext creates objects of beans via reading from xml based configurations
or annotation based configurations.

Life cycle of a bean:
(1)init()
(2)constructor
(3)setter

BeanNameAware				--	(4)setter
BeanFactoryAware			--	(5)setter
ApplicationContextAware		--	(6)setter

InitializingBean			--	(8)afterPropertiesSet()			--	@PostConstruct
DisposableBean				--	(10)destroy()					--	@PreDestroy
BeanPostProcessor			--	(7)postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)
								(9)postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)

ServletContextAware 		--	setter
ServletConfigAware			--	setter
					
observer-design-pattern


BeanPostProcessor  - custom logic is executed before and after initializing the bean(initialization methods)
BeanPostProcessors are scoped per-container
AOP auto-proxying is implemented as a BeanPostProcessor
RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor
AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor

All BeanPostProcessors and beans that they reference directly are instantiated on startup, 
as part of the special startup phase of the ApplicationContext. 
Next, all BeanPostProcessors are registered in a sorted fashion and 
applied to all further beans in the container.


BeanFactoryPostProcessor - works on bean configuration metadata like xml
They are scoped per-container.
PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer  - reads data from properties file and places actual content in xml files

(Q) Diff b/w InitializingBean and BeanPostProcessor?
->BeanPostProcessor are scoped per container
->BeanPostProcessor is called once for every bean in ApplicationContext.
->InitializingBean is declared only for one bean

<context:annotation-config/>
http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd
This will automatically register all of Spring's standard post-processors for annotation-based configuration
only looks for annotations on beans in the same application context in which it is defined.
@Required , @Autowired

@Autowired, @Inject, @Resource, and @Value annotations are handled by a Spring BeanPostProcessor implementations which in turn means 
that you cannot apply these annotations within your own BeanPostProcessor or BeanFactoryPostProcessor

@Qualifier
associate qualifier values with specific arguments, narrowing the set of type matches
NOTE : the bean name is considered a default qualifier value

@Resource
Directly get the bean by its defined name
JSR 250
If no name is specified explicitly, the default name is derived from the field name or setter method
@Resource(name="abc")

=>Difference b/w @Resource and @Autowired
(1) Autowired picks up the bean via type and qualifier applies a filter over it.
    But @Resource picks up the bean via name.
	
(2) beans that are themselves defined as a collection or map type cannot be injected through @Autowired

(3) @Autowired applies to fields, constructors, and multi-argument methods
	@Resource is supported only for fields and bean property setter methods with a single argument

***https://www.sourceallies.com/2011/08/spring-injection-with-resource-and-autowired/

@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. 
@Repository, @Service, and @Controller are specializations of @Component for more specific use cases

(Q) Can @Repository, @Service, and @Controller be interchangeably used?
@Controller supports mvc related annotations
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15922991/is-spring-annotation-controller-same-as-service
@Repository supports persistence exception translation
	http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=120

@RestController == @Controller and @ResponseBody

NOTE: The use of <context:component-scan> implicitly enables the functionality of <context:annotation-config>

@Inject with @Named
@Named can be used with @Inject
@Named can be used as @Component

@Any


NOTE : In Spring, instantiated beans have a singleton scope by default. This is where the magic comes in: 
	All @Configuration classes are subclassed at startup-time with CGLIB. 
	In the subclass, the child method checks the container first
	for any cached (scoped) beans before it calls the parent method and creates a new instance.
	
	
@Configuration  - xml configuration
@Bean           - bean in xml
@Profile        - profile of bean(s) in configuration

Environment - profile and properties
Different profiles are used for different environment

-------------------------

Scope of bean:
Singleton
Prototype
Request
Session
Application

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25000406/how-many-instances-created-for-singleton-bean-referring-to-a-session-bean-protot
(Q)How to inject session bean in a singleton bean?

	<bean name="singletonBean" class="somepkg.SingletonBean">
		<property name="someProperty" ref="sessionBean"/>
	</bean>
	
	<bean name="sessionBean" class="somepkg.SessionBean" scope="session">
		<aop:scoped-proxy/>
	</bean>
	
	@Component
	@Scope(value = "session", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)
	
	@Bean
	@Scope(value="session", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
	
(Q)How to inject prototype bean in a singleton bean?

	<bean name="singletonBean" class="somepkg.SingletonBean">
		<lookup-method name="someProperty" bean="prototypeBean"/>
	</bean>
	
	<bean name="prototypeBean" class="PrototypeBean" scope="prototype">
		
	</bean>

	Here CGLIB does bytecode generation and provides new prototype object everytime.
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26028341/how-to-use-spring-lookup-annotation

	@Component
	public class MyClass1 {
	  doSomething() {
	    myClass2();
	  }
	
	  //I want this method to return MyClass2 prototype
	  @Lookup
	  public MyClass2 myClass2(){
	    return null; // This implementation will be overridden by dynamically generated subclass
	  }
	}

========Data Binding and validations========

An application can also register additional Spring Validator instances per DataBinder instance

====================================================

(Q)What is spring IOC ?
(Q)How Spring implemented it?
(Q)types of DI ?
constructor
setter

IOC means inversion of control i.e. control is in framework's hand.
Dependency Injection is implemented via IOC.

for eg: if bean A requires bean B , then spring injects bean B inside bean A.
Both bean A and B have to register themselves in spring container.

There are many lifecycle interfaces and Aware interfaces in spring that helps it to perform DI.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3058/what-is-inversion-of-control
->don't call us, we'll call you

imagine a class which exposes a service which needs many more dependencies to be satisfied,
 which, in turn, have dependencies on other services

you won't even need to call its constructor. Someone else will do it on your behalf.

The main point of a framework which offers IoC and DI is a software component called container. 
As its name implies, the container will achieve knowledge about components needed by your application
 to run and will try to be smart enough to understand which component you want.

The other fundamental feature of the container is that it will be able to resolve-and inject-dependencies
 between your objects; hence the name Dependency Injection.


=====================================================
Spring AOP is proxy-based.

(1)standard JDK dynamic proxies		=> when implementing interfaces
(2)CGLIB							=> when not implementing interfaces (proxies are created by classes)

**NOTE** : CGLIB is used by default if a business object does not implement an interface.
It is possible to force the use of CGLIB, in those (hopefully rare) cases where you need to advice a method that is not declared
 on an interface, or where you need to pass a proxied object to a method as a concrete type.
If the target object to be proxied implements at least one interface then a JDK dynamic proxy will be used
 
 Spring AOP based on @AspectJ
 Spring AOP schema based  i.e. xml based
 
==>By autoproxying we mean that if Spring determines that a bean is adviced by one or more aspects, 
it will automatically generate a proxy for that bean to intercept method invocations and ensure that advice is executed as needed.

@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class AppConfig {........}

<aop:aspectj-autoproxy/>


=>final methods cannot be adviced, as they cannot be overridden.
=>The constructor of your proxied object will be called twice when implemented via CGLIB.
Using JDK dynamic proxies one constructor call will be done but in case of CGLIB two instances will be created.

=> To force proxy class implementation using CGLIB
<aop:aspectj-autoproxy proxy-target-class="true"/>

constructor runs two times with cglib
*****http://forum.spring.io/forum/spring-projects/container/342-constructor-called-twice-when-using-cglib-proxy-beans


the method serving as the pointcut signature must have a void return type

pointCut designators =>
(1)execution
(2)this		-- refrence to proxy object
(3)target		-- refrence to actual object
(4)args
(5)within
(6)annotation
(7)bean

Advice =>

@Before
@AfterReturning			-- can get returned value
@AfterThrowing			-- can get thrown exception
@After (After finally)	-- 

Around advice is often used if you need to share state before and after a method execution in a thread-safe manner 
(starting and stopping a timer for example)

=>We can get arguments of a method in our aspect using args()
=>We can add JoinPoint refrence to our join point method so that we can get all the information regarding it.
=>Around advice already contain PrecedingJoinPoint refrence

execution(modifiers-pattern? ret-type-pattern declaring-type-pattern? name-pattern(param-pattern) throws-pattern?)

public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
	joinPoint.getSignature().getName();
}

@After("inTrading()")
public void logAfter(JoinPoint joinPoint) {}

@AfterReturning		-- get returned value
@AfterThrowing		-- get thrown value
@Around				-- get before and after state in thread safe manner with PrecedingJoinPoint

@Around("mixOfTwo()")
public void myAround(PrecedingJoinPoint joinPoint) {
	//before work
	joinPoint.proceed();
	//after work
}


--Where proxy implements AccountService
this(com.xyz.service.AccountService)

--Where target object implements AccountService
target(com.xyz.service.AccountService)

--where the argument passed at runtime is Serializable
args(java.io.Serializable)

--Executing method has a @Transactional annotation
@annotation(org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional)

--A spring bean named tradeService
bean(tradeService)

&&    ||   !

--Handling exception
@AfterThrowing(pointcut="com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.dataAccessOperation()",throwing="ex")
    public void doRecoveryActions(DataAccessException ex) {
        //
    }


--Getting arguments
@Before("com.xyz.myapp.SystemArchitecture.dataAccessOperation() && args(account,..)")
public void validateAccount(Account account) {
    // ...
}
	

Note : Point cut method never executes itself.
Note : Advice is applied on only public methods

Spring Data Tier

PlatformTransactionManager

TransactionStatus getTransaction(TransactionDefinition definition) throws TransactionException;
void commit(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;
void rollback(TransactionStatus status) throws TransactionException;


TransactionDefinition
TransactionStatus

TransactionDefinition includes following parameters :
Isolation
Propagation
Timeout
Read-only status

There are various implementations of PlatformTransactionManager :
JDBC
JTA
Hibernate

http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/jndi-resources-howto.html#JDBC_Data_Sources

https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.3/manual/en-US/html_single/


Spring Framework transaction infrastructure code only marks a transaction for rollback in the case of runtime, unchecked exceptions;
Checked exceptions that are thrown from a transactional method do not result in rollback in the default configuration.

<tx:advice id="txAdvice" transaction-manager="txManager">
...
<tx:method name="get*" read-only="true" rollback-for="NoProductInStockException"/>
<tx:method name="updateStock" no-rollback-for="InstrumentNotFoundException"/>
</tx:advice>

@transactional annotation can be applied to 
(1)a method on an interface, 
(2)a class definition, or 
(3)a public method on a class

There may be more than one transaction manager in one application
The value attribute of the @Transactional annotation can be used to optionally specify the identity of the PlatformTransactionManager to be used

Log4J

http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/how-do-i-change-my-log4j-settings-while-my-web-application-is-running.html

(1)Log4j has three main components: loggers, appenders and layouts. 
(2)"com.foo" is a parent of "com.foo.Bar"
(3)The inherited level for a given logger C, is equal to the first non-null level in the logger hierarchy, 
	starting at C and proceeding upwards in the hierarchy towards the root logger.
(4)Logging requests are made by invoking one of the printing methods of a logger instance. 
	These printing methods are debug, info, warn, error, fatal and log.
(5)A log request of level p in a logger with (either assigned or inherited, whichever is appropriate) level q, is enabled if p >= q.
(6)an output destination is called an appender.
(7)More than one appender can be attached to a logger.
	Each enabled logging request for a given logger will be forwarded to all the appenders in that logger as well as the appenders higher
	in the hierarchy.
	Additivity is set to true by default, that is children inherit the appenders of their ancestors by default.
(8)The layout is responsible for formatting the logging request according to the user's wishes, 
	whereas an appender takes care of sending the formatted output to its destination.
