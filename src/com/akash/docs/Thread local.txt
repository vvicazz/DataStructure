Thread local are those objects whose values are associated with each thread.
Each thread has a separate copy of threadLocal.
Each thread can use its threadLocal variable across all methods that are executed inside thread's stack.
i.e. both gloabl and local
global to all methods of thread
local to thread only (not visible to other threads)
set() and get() methods of ThreadLocal class uses Thread.currentThread() to operate.

When to use :
mostly used as private static variable
When you want to assign a unique transaction id to multiple threads

How implemented internally:
Each thread object has a map as <ThreadLocal,Object> which stores a mapping of threadLocal to Object.
	
	/* ThreadLocal values pertaining to this thread. This map is maintained
     * by the ThreadLocal class. */
    ThreadLocal.ThreadLocalMap threadLocals = null;

=>The class is package private to allow declaration of fields in class Thread.
=>the hash table entries use WeakReferences for keys
=>No operations are exported outside of the ThreadLocal class
