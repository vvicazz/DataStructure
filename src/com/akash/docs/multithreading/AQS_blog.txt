class AQS  {
	private transient volatile Node head;
	private transient volatile Node tail;
	private volatile int state;
	
	static final class Node {
		static final int CANCELLED =  1;
		//Non-negative values mean that a node doesn't need to signal

		//In case of shared mode, empty Node object is saved.

When a new thread comes and no thread is waiting, then it is allowed to run.
If a thread has already acquired lock and a new thread tries to acquire the lock, 
then it is inserted in the linked list of nodes.
Nodes are inserted after tail and removed from head, i.e. it is treated as a Queue.
ReentrantLock maintains :
	head and tail : for making a queue of nodes in the form of linked list
	state : variable used to determine if lock is acquired by one or more threads or not
		eg: In ReentrantLock, if c > 0 then it means lock is held by some thread.
Every node maintains :
	waitStatus : status of current thread
	prev and next : previous and next node in linked list
	thread : running thread which is parked
	nextWaiter : is used by ConditionObject to store queue of threads for condition predicate

----------------

Below is the example of how to use ReentrantLock with ConditionObject :

Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
Condition condition1 = lock.newCondition();

void foo() {
	lock.lock();
	try {
		while(preCondition == false) {
			condition1.await();
		}
		...
		...
		condition1.signal();
	}
	finally {
		lock.unlock();
	}
}

Now lets try go underneath and understand, how it really works:
ReentrantLock has to different implementations of AQS : Fair Synchronizer and NonFair Synchronizer.
In NonFair sync , if a new thread asks for a resource and resource is available,
 then resource is provided to that thread, irrespective of the fact 
 that any other thread has been waiting for this resource for long time.
In Fair sync, a fair policy is used to provide resources to threads on the basis of their timings.

Lets try to understand Non fair policy :

ReentrantLock$NonfairSync class
final void lock() {
    if (compareAndSetState(0, 1))	//setting AQS state from 0 to 1 atomically
        setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread.currentThread());
    else
        acquire(1);
}

AbstractQueuedSynchronizer class
public final void acquire(int arg) {
    if (!tryAcquire(arg) && acquireQueued(addWaiter(Node.EXCLUSIVE), arg))
        selfInterrupt();
}

If tryAcquire() returns true, current thread is allowed to execute without any wait.
If tryAcquire() returns false, acquireQueued() method is called which internally parks the thread, using LockSupport.park() and thread becomes disabled.

ReentrantLock$NonfairSync class
protected final boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
	return nonfairTryAcquire(acquires);
}

ReentrantLock$Sync class
final boolean nonfairTryAcquire(int acquires) {
	final Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
	int c = getState();
	if (c == 0) {
		if (compareAndSetState(0, acquires)) {		// increment state atomically
			setExclusiveOwnerThread(current);
			return true;
		}
	}
	else if (current == getExclusiveOwnerThread()) {
		int nextc = c + acquires;
		setState(nextc);				// increment state atomically
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}

(Q) How Threads are parked in java ?
Ans: java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport

class LockSupport {
	private static final sun.misc.Unsafe UNSAFE;
	Class<?> tk = Thread.class;
	
	//Getting offset of parkBlocker variable from Thread class
	//This is implemented to atomically update parkBlocker for the caller object (ReentrantLock in our case)
    private static final long parkBlockerOffset = UNSAFE.objectFieldOffset(tk.getDeclaredField("parkBlocker"));

	private static void setBlocker(Thread t, Object arg) {
		UNSAFE.putObject(t, parkBlockerOffset, arg);
	}

	public static void unpark(Thread thread) {
		if (thread != null)
			UNSAFE.unpark(thread);
	}

	//blocker is object of ReentrantLock, in our case
	public static void park(Object blocker) {
		Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
		setBlocker(t, blocker);
		UNSAFE.park(false, 0L);
		setBlocker(t, null);
	}
}

public class Thread implements Runnable {
	volatile Object parkBlocker;
}

Above code can be understood as :
when current thread calls LockSupport.park() method ,by passing object of ReentrantLock class,
current thread is disabled and parkBlocker = object of ReentrantLock class

Now lets try to understand unlock() :

ReentrantLock class
public void unlock() {
	sync.release(1);
}

AbstractQueuedSynchronizer class
public final boolean release(int arg) {
	if (tryRelease(arg)) {
		Node h = head;
		if (h != null && h.waitStatus != 0)
			unparkSuccessor(h);
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}

ReentrantLock$Sync class
protected final boolean tryRelease(int releases) {
	int c = getState() - releases;
	if (Thread.currentThread() != getExclusiveOwnerThread())
		throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
	boolean free = false;
	if (c == 0) {
		free = true;
		setExclusiveOwnerThread(null);
	}
	setState(c);
	return free;
}

If tryRelease() returns true, unparkSuccessor() is called which internally calls LockSupport.unpark() and disabled thread starts running.
If tryRelease() returns false, disabled threads still needs to wait for signal.


A queue is maintained for the threads having same condition object, i.e. same condition predicate.
firstWaiter and lastWaiter are head and tail of queue
Every node has nextWaiter, which determines next waiting thread in same condition queue.
