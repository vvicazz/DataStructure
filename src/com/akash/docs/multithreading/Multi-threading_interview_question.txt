Multi-threading interview question

1) what are the ways to create a thread and which is better: Thread,Runnable
2) why wait, notify and notifyAll are in object class? why they called inside syncronized ?
3) diff bw sleep and wait
4) ThreadLocal : set(), get(), initialValue()
5) ThreadGroup
6) what is ThreadPool ? How to create our own ThreadPool
7) diff bw syncronized method and block
8) daemon thread
9)-- Java Timer classes
10) diff bw Lock api and syncronized keyword -> 
		try methods, interruptible, fair-unfair, 
		separate Condition object for different diff condition queues.
11) Executor framework
12) Why atomic class are better than Lock api - 
	CAS -> compare and swap , it opportunisticly updates the variable
	These operations are implemented atomically at processor level
	client api has to deal with contention
	AtomicLong, AtomicInteger, AtomicBoolean, AtomicReference
	
13) Runnable, Future (get,isDone,cancel), Callable(call) , RunnableFuture, FutureTask (RunnableFuture)
14)-- ways to avoid deadlock
15)-- CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, Semaphore
16) volatile keyword
17) Why suspend() and resume() methods are deprecated
18) how to stop a thread 
Q) How ThreadPoolExecutor works? How FutureTask works ?
	What are various types of pool executors in java, 
	i.e. various implementations of ExecutorService interface in java
	How state of pool is managed and how state of threads inside pool is managed ?
	Advantages of executor framework ?
19) create your own ThreadPoolExecutor ?
20)-- ReadWriteLock
21) diff bw volatile and atomic 
	-> volatile provides visibility guaranty, but not atomicity
	
22)-- fork-join framework in java
23)-- ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet, ConcurrentSkipListMap
