In English, Volatile means "liable to change rapidly and unpredictably".

When multiple threads operate on a single shared object,their may be a case where
different threads may have memory inconsistency issues with that shared variable.
Threads operates on variable by first making a copy of that variable in their own CPU cache,
then they operate that copy in CPU register.

eg:
Thread A reads x
Thread B reads x
Thread A increments x by 1
Thread B increments x by 1
Thread A writes back x to main memory
Thread B writes back x to main memory

now x=1
ideally x must be 2.


Java memory model
Multiple threads have their own stack but they all share same heap space.
Shared objects reside in heap.

At Hardware level
Operations are performed on CPU registers.
Shared objects reside in RAM space so that every cpu can access shared variable.
CPU has their own cache for doing any operation.

For Read operation
RAM -> CPU cache -> CPU register

For Write operation
RAM <- CPU cache <- CPU register

These operations are not atomic and may result some inconsistency when multiple threads interleaved with these operations.
Making a variable as Volatile guarantee that read operation is atomic and write operation is atomic.
It guarantees a HAPPENS BEFORE relationship between two operations.
i.e.
write to a volatile variable by thread A
read from a volatile variable by thread B

write operation HAPPENS BEFORE read operation as both are atomic.

(Q)When to use volatile :
Ans : When you have one thread that writes a shared variable and all other thread reads that shared variable.

(Q)When to use Synchronized with Volatile :
Ans : When more than one thread try to write on shared variable

(Q)If a shared variable is accessed by multiple threads for read/write operation ,
 then is it neccessary to make it synchronized and volatile both ?
Ans : 
synchronized keyword makes a code block executed by a single thread thread only by keeping its monitor.
volatile makes the read as atomic and write as atomic.
But volatile alone cannot make both read and write operation as a single atomic operation.

(Q)Is Volatile variable only effective for primitive types OR can we use it for non-primitive custom objects(stateful objects) ?
Ans :

==============


=>Java volatile keyword guarantees visibility of changes to variables across threads
=>JVM guarantees that every read of the variable will always be read from main memory,
 and that all writes to the variable will always be written back to main memory
=>Using volatile variables reduces the risk of memory consistency errors, because any write to a volatile variable
 establishes a happens-before relationship with subsequent reads of that same variable.
 This means that changes to a volatile variable are always visible to other threads.
 If Thread A writes to a volatile variable and Thread B subsequently reads the same volatile variable,
 then all variables visible to Thread A before writing the volatile variable, will also be visible to Thread B.
=>Reads and writes are atomic for all variables declared volatile (including long and double variables).
=>You need to use synchronization in that case to guarantee that the reading and writing of the variable is atomic
=>Reading from and writing to main memory is more expensive than accessing the CPU cache.
=>Effectively, a variable declared volatile must have it’s data synchronized across all threads,
 so that whenever you access or update the variable in any thread, all other threads immediately see the same value.
