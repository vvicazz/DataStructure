JDBC and J2EE basics:

NOTE : Each request thread in a J2EE environment gets a single connection from Each Resource.
There may be multiple resources for a single request, 
so there will be single transaction for each request.

Connection Object in JDBC has methods :
commit()
rollback()

By default, for a JDBC connection AutoCommit is set to true.
i.e. Each Query is treated as single transaction.

For executing multiple statements, we have to call setAutoCommit(false)

conn.commit();
conn.rollback();

SavePoint : points in transactions that can be committed or rollback separately.


=======================================================
Hibernate :

tx = session.getTransaction();

tx.begin()

session.flush();

tx.commit();

session.close();

(Q)Difference bw session.flush() and tx.commit() ?
flush : transfer data to DB but do not commit
commit : transfer data to DB and commit

(Q)When flush() method is executed?

(1)flush() called
(2)commit called
(3)Before running a query, when any query(HQL,native,named,Criteria) executed session data is flush to avoid getting Stale objects.
Only those dirty objects are flushed before running a query that are included in query.

FlushMode : 
Manual	: call manualy only
Commit	: when commit is called
Auto	: when query is fired to avoid stale object, This is default
Always	: Every query

How Transactional works in Spring

(1)Transaction Manager
(2)Transaction Interceptor
(3)Transactional proxy

(1)Transactional proxy :
EntityManager proxy class which will operate jpa/hibernate operations.
SharedEntityManagerInvocationHandler is the proxy class.

class SharedEntityManagerInvocationHandler implements java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler

public Object invoke(Object proxy,Method method,Object[] arrgs) {
...
method.invoke(target,args);
..
}


(2)Transaction Interceptor :
@Around advice for PlatformTransactionManager
Any method in Spring that is annotated with @Transactional annotation will be intercepted by this class.

class TransactionInterceptor extends TransactionAspectSupport implements MethodInterceptor

public Object invoke(final MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable

=>This interceptor will decide if transaction has to commit or rollback.


(3)Transaction Manager
its main role is to link entityManager with Connection.
JpatransactionManager is an implementation.
its getTransaction() method checks the current transaction and create/suspend transaction accordingly.
It checks if transaction has to be propagated or a new transaction has to be created.
When Requires_new propagation is used ,then old connection in old transaction is suspended and
new connection is opened.

PROPAGATION_REQUIRED , PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW
ISOLATION_LEVEL = READ_COMMITED , READ_UNCOMMITED


Note : All Runtime exceptions (unchecked exception) sets markAsRollbackOnly=true.
This will rollback the transaction at the end.
If a checked exception occurs inside a transaction method, it will never be rollback by itself.


1.public class MyController {
2.
3.	@Transactional
4.	public void myMethod() {
5.		Person p = new Person();
6.		entityManager.persist(p);
7.	}
8.}

********NOTE*********

(1)Control will go to TransactionInterceptor.invoke
(2)Control will go to line 5
(3)control will go to line 6 -> which transfer control to SharedEntityManagerInvocationHandler.invoke
