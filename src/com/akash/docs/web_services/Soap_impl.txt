Server Side Configuration :

(1)Create an XSD file in integration project. XSD file will help us to create wsdl file and stub classes at server side. 
The XSD file can be kept at "src\main\resources\ws\schema" location. 
For e.g:   /neutrino-integration-globalcustomer-webapp/src/main/resources/ws/schema/NegativeChecklistFileUpload.xsd .
 Every xsd file must have a targetNamespace url. This namespace will be used while making an endpoint in step 5. 
 If you are refering elements from other xsd or from same xsd then, you need to import it via xmlns . 
 For example xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" OR xmlns:xmime="http://www.w3.org/2005/05/xmlmime" .

(2)Now you have to create Stub classes for this XSD at server side. You can use JAXB plugin of eclipse to create stub classes. 
Right click on xsd file-> New -> other -> JAXB -> JAXB classes from schema 

(3)Now we have to create a wsdl for this xsd file . Just create a bean for class NeutrinoWsdlDefination . 
(This class is just a copy of DefaultWsdl11Definition) . Pass the path of xsd in  xsds  property of this bean . 
This bean will create a wsdl for your xsd at specified location. 
For eg: see bean negativeChecklistFileUploadServiceWsdlDefination  in  integration-globalcustomer-webapp-root-app-context.xml

(4)As  NeutrinoWsdlDefination created the wsdl for us, we just need to expose it. Spring will do this task for us.
 <sws:static-wsdl >  tag will help us to expose it. You just need to provide the path for wsdl file. 
 Eg: negativeChecklistFileUploadService in integration-globalcustomer-webapp-root-app-context.xml .

(5)Now we have to create an Endpoint for this wsdl. For this we will make a camel endpoint in a camel route file. 
Eg: negativeChecklistFileUploadEndpoint in integration-globalcustomer-route-context.xml .  
The endpoint will include namespace of the wsdl and Request object.

(6)A camel route will be created for this endpoint. The route will have contain a camel component for handling the request , 
it can be a processor bean, for eg: negativeChecklistFileUploadProcessor .



Client Side Configuration :

(1)First we have to make client stub classes from WSDL file created at server side. For this we will use jaxws-maven-plugin . 
Here we have to specify 
(A)Wsdl file location , 
(B)package name for stub to be created and 
(C)unique stalefile name. 

See pom.xml file of neutrino-cas-integration project. 
Also you need to specify the package name of the client stub in contextPaths  property of  Jaxb2Marshaller  bean.

(2)To make a client  we just need to create a new class that inherit AbstractMessageExchangeClient.java class. 
You also need to implement abstract method public void setWebServiceUrl(String webServiceUrl) .  
WebServiceUrl will specify the soap service url for which this client is created. You can specify the url string with @Value annotation.
Now create a Request object for the web service and call method webServiceTemplate.marshalSendAndReceive(webServiceUrl,request);
